Proposed Title Change: 

From Principal Information Security Architect to Enterprise Security Architect 

Talking Points 

Rob’s been recognized twice with the IT Technology Award for delivering innovative solutions that advanced major business initiatives—his influence clearly extends well beyond his immediate team. 

He also received the Ericsson Award, which speaks to his leadership on high-value, cross-functional projects that delivered measurable enterprise-wide benefits. 

He’s played a pivotal role in shaping the security architecture for critical initiatives like Digital Service Platform/BreatheIQ, Enterprise Payments and Pay by Link, the Sleep Number Integration Platform, and FourKites—ensuring secure cloud migrations and strong risk management throughout. 

Rob developed reusable safeguard design patterns for both cloud and on-prem environments. These patterns have helped standardize our approach, improve scalability, and accelerate secure delivery across teams. 

He’s led efforts to streamline processes and integrate technologies across areas like network perimeter, external attack surface, and hosted services—reducing risk and improving operational efficiency. 

Rob has been a key partner to development, security engineering, and CSOC teams—leading security assessments like threat hunting, vulnerability scans, and secure code reviews that uncovered and mitigated high-impact risks. 

He’s also helped elevate our enterprise-wide security standards, aligning them with NIST, OWASP, and internal policies, and influencing how we approach secure software development and cloud infrastructure. 

Recommended Area of Ownership: Supply Chain Operational Technology (OT) 

Rob is proposing to formally own the OT architecture domain, which is a natural extension of his current work and a critical area for the company’s future. 

He would lead the development of a cohesive architecture strategy that bridges IT and OT—ensuring consistent controls, aligned risk management, and stronger overall security. 

He’d also drive digital transformation within OT, embedding security into the design and deployment of industrial systems, IoT, and other critical infrastructure. 

And importantly, he’d serve as the key liaison between IT, OT, and business leadership, ensuring alignment with strategic goals and improving resilience across the board.
